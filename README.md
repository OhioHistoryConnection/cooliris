# CoolIris Image Wall for CONTENTdm

The **CoolIris Image Wall for CONTENTdm** is a lightly modified version of the
extension that is available from the [CONTENTdm User Support Center](http://www.contentdm.org/USC). The only two 
things that have been modified are 1) adjusting the image dimensions prior to rendering to improve
load time for the image wall, especially in collections that contain high resolution images; and 
2) suppressing all page-level images of a compound (except the first image).

Implementation:

1) The modified add-on assumes that all files live in their own "Custom Pages" folder
called "cooliris". If you change that location, then you will need to change the paths in
both addon_cooliriswindow.html and addon_cooliris.js.

2) The file addon_cooliris.js should be added as a bottom include script either
globally or on a selection collection.

These scripts are distributed "as is", and neither I nor the Ohio History Connection 
accept liability of any kind. If you do make improvements on the application, however, 
please consider notifying me and the rest of the CONTENTdm community!
